Hi! I'm Connick, and this is a new project of mine called _Hidden Infrastructure_. My goal is to share my obsession with "hidden infrastructure". To do that, let me start by explaining my emotional attachment to it and elaborating on why I am so fascinated by things of this nature.

Everything began with my discovery of [urban exploration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_exploration), which is the “exploration of manmade structures, usually abandoned ruins or hidden components of the manmade environment”. This concept captivated me because I had never considered the existence of things like that. It was like a whole new world had been exposed. I went down a long rabbit hole of [YouTube videos](https://youtu.be/vWF3IDk9Gek) and Internet sleuthing, but I never did any UrbEx myself (mostly because it often involves trespassing).

Still, from that moment on, I began to take in the world around me differently. I deliberately looked for things out of place and researched what stood out to me. My weird and hard-to-describe emotional attachment to these unseen artifacts also heightened. To this day (even when writing this) I still struggle to describe the feeling I get when I discover that something interesting is hiding in plain sight. At some point, as my fascination only got crazier, I realized I want to share my hobby and obsession with the world, so the _Hidden Infra_ project was born.

My plan for this website is to use the blog to educate interested readers while I work on the main attraction: a map and directory that documents the hidden pieces of our lives with information and photos of the things I find so compelling. I would like others to be able to contribute as well (think Wikipedia but for hidden infrastructure). If you would like to help me on this journey, want to ask me any questions, or have something to share, feel free to reach out to [contact@hiddeninfra.com](mailto:contact@hiddeninfra.com).
