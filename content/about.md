My goal for this project is to share my obsession with "hidden infrastructure". To do that, I should start by explaining my emotional attachment to it and elaborating on why I am so fascinated by things of this nature.

Everything started with my discovery of [urban exploration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_exploration), which is the “exploration of manmade structures, usually abandoned ruins or hidden components of the manmade environment”. This concept captivated me because I had never considered the existence of things like that. It was like a whole new world had been exposed. I went down a long rabbit hole of [YouTube videos](https://youtu.be/vWF3IDk9Gek) and Internet sleuthing, but I never did any UrbEx myself (mostly because it often involves trespassing).

Still, from that moment on, I began to take in the world around me differently. I deliberately looked for things out of place and researched what stood out to me. My weird and hard-to-describe emotional attachment to these unseen artifacts also heightened. To this day (even when writing this) I still struggle to describe the feeling I get when I learn about hidden infrastructure. At some point, however, as my fascination only got crazier, I realized I wanted to share my hobby and obsession with the world, so _Hidden Infra_ was born.

My plan for this website is to use the blog to ensnare and educate interested readers while I work on the main attraction: a map that documents the hidden pieces of our lives with information and photos of what I find so compelling. I would like others to be able to contribute as well (think Wikipedia but for hidden infrastructure). If you would like to help me on this journey, want to ask me any questions, or have something to share, feel free to reach out at [contact@hiddeninfra.com](mailto:contact@hiddeninfra.com).
